		<h2 id="populationandhousing">Population and Households</h2>
      <p>Housing can be broken into two parts.  The housing units and the people that live in them. The City’s housing programs and policies target both parts. This section focuses on the occupants of housing units.  When one or more people live together in a single housing unit they are considered a household.  Looking at the number of people and households in Sacramento over time provides context for the City’s housing programs and policies.</p>

		<h2 id="occupancyandtenure">Renters and Owners</h2>
      <p>Sacramento is a city dominated by renters. Historically, 2/3 of households are renters. Rental units are located throughout the city but concentrated in the north eastern portion, while owner units represent the majority of the housing stock in the south western part of the city. Explore the trends and distribution of tenure in the charts below.</p>

		<h2 id="housingaffordability">Housing Affordability</h2>
      <p>There is general agreement that if you pay no more than 30% of your income on housing, your housing is "affordable".  If you pay over 30% the census considers you “housing-cost burdened.”</p>
		<p>The Census publishes estimates of the population that are housing-cost burdened. In San Francisco, estimates from 2014 suggest that over a third of renters and owners with mortgages meet this criteria.</p>
		<p>The charts below explore this issue by showing affordability and monthly costs by tenure.</p>
