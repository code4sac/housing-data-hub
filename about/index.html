    <h2 id="whyhousingpolicyhub">Why a Housing Data Hub?</h2>
    <p>The Housing Data Hub was born out of a need to have a single place to learn:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the City of Sacramento doing about affordable housing?</li>
      <li>What data is available about each of the policies and programs related to affordable housing?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We wanted to enrich the content about the housing programs with their supporting data. We hope that readily available content, data and visuals spurs new thinking and approaches to affordable housing in the City.</p>
    <h2 id="our-process">A process of continuous improvement</h2>
    <p>Our philosophy is that it is better to release something sooner versus waiting for a perfect launch. We are releasing our datasets in phases.</p>
    <h3>Code for San Francissco</h3>
		<p>This version of the website was derived from the fantastic work that <a href="http://www.codeforsanfrancisco.org">Code for San Francisco</a> did with their <a href="https://housing.datasf.org/">Housing Data Hub</a>. Their hard work made it possible to stand this site up with limited resources and to get the discussion started.</p>    
    <h3>Open source community</h3>
    <p>This project is built on some incredible open source tools and inspirations that made our job a whole lot easier:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is our static site compiler of choice. It has served us well and it allows us to host the Housing Data Hub on a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/">gh-pages branch in GitHub to boot</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> is a well-supported library for manipulating the DOM and doing other neat tricks with Javascript with a little less code.</li>
      <li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 3</a> provides all the scaffolding and UI basics to get us going quickly.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.c3js.org">C3</a> is a wonderful library built around <a href="http://d3js.org">D3</a> that gives us power without complexity including beautiful easy to configure, reusable charts.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/daguar">Dave Guarino's</a> lovely <a href="https://github.com/daguar/easy-choropleths">easy-choropleth</a> project was the inspiration for the pattern we took with our choropleth mapping, but instead of Google Sheets we use trusty, reliable CSVs to power the map data.</li>
      <li><a href="http://colorbrewer2.org">Colorbrewer2.org</a> provides a <a href="http://colorbrewer2.org/export/colorbrewer.js">tiny javascript library</a> that lets us quickly configure Color Brewer based ramps in code, which is very helpful for choropleth maps.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v2.1.4/">Mapbox.js</a> is a <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet-based</a> library that let's us connect quickly to our Mapbox basemaps and put data on a map.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/mapbox/leaflet-omnivore">Leaflet Omnivore</a> chews on CSVs and spits out mappable layers for Leaflet</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.fullscreen">Leaflet fullscreen</a> enables a map to go full screen so you can look at all that delicious data without distractions.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/prose/prose">Prose</a> provides us with a nice framework for allowing humans to actually edit content and plays nicely with Jekyll.</li>
