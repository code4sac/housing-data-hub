Residential development in San Francisco, as in other cities, must move through a planning and permitting process leading to eventual construction.  The size of projects that go through planning range from 1 unit additions to very large planned projects and everything in between. While this is a process constantly in motion the below chart is a snapshot in time for the 2nd quarter of 2016.  The chart below shows the number of added units by status and size of the building.  For example we see that in the 2nd quarter of 2016 the majority of the units in the construction phase came from very large projects that involved structures with at least 250 units.
